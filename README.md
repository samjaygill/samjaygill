- 👋 Hello World, I’m Samantha.

- 👀 I’m interested in the endless possibilities that coding unlocks and how technology can transform our world.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and expanding my skill set after successfully completing CodeClan's 16-week immersive course. As a career changer from administration, I've dived deep into Python, JavaScript, Java, databases and testing.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge and inspire, as I embark on my journey as a junior software developer.

- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjaygill/ - Feel free to connect, whether it's about coding, collaboration, or just a friendly chat!
