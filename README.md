<h4>👋 Hello World, I’m Samantha.</h4>

👀 I’m interested in the endless possibilities that coding unlocks and how technology can transform our world.


🌱 I’m currently learning and expanding my skill set after successfully completing CodeClan's 16-week immersive course. As a career changer from administration, I've dived deep into Python, JavaScript, Java, databases and testing.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge and inspire, as I embark on my journey as a junior software developer.
